description: Critically review PRDs and implementation plans to identify gaps, blind spots, contradictions, and delivery risks before coding begins. Use when asked to review product docs, technical specs, implementation plans, migration/deletion plans, acceptance criteria, or rollout strategy; produce ranked findings by severity (critical, major, normal, low) with concrete remediation and exact document updates.

# Peer Reviewer

## Objective

Deliver a high-signal peer review for planning artifacts before implementation starts.
Prioritize defects and execution risks, not writing style.

## Inputs

Provide:
1. Target document path(s) to review.
2. Optional related references (code, schema, migration files, linked docs).
3. Optional review focus (for example: data contracts, testability, rollout risk).

## Workflow

1. Read the target doc end-to-end and build a requirement map:
- goals, non-goals, acceptance criteria, dependencies, constraints, open questions.
2. Cross-check internal consistency:
- detect contradictions between goals, acceptance criteria, and technical approach.
3. Validate feasibility against implementation reality:
- compare required behavior with existing CLI, contracts, DB schema, and test patterns.
4. Run risk lenses:
- scope boundaries, backward compatibility, data integrity, observability, testability, delivery sequencing, migration/deletion safety.
5. Produce findings ranked by severity with concrete remediation and PRD/plan update instructions.

## Severity Rubric

Use exactly these labels:
1. `critical`: Release-blocking contradiction or missing requirement that can cause wrong behavior, data loss/corruption, severe security/compliance risk, or invalid scope.
2. `major`: High-impact gap likely to cause rework, failed delivery, or materially incorrect/ambiguous implementation.
3. `normal`: Important clarity/testability/operability issue that should be fixed for reliable execution but is not release-blocking.
4. `low`: Improvement for precision, maintainability, or readability with limited delivery risk.

## Review Lenses

Use all lenses, then emphasize the highest-risk areas:
1. Problem framing: Is the problem measurable and tied to user/business outcomes?
2. Scope boundaries: Are non-goals explicit and enforceable?
3. Requirements quality: Are acceptance criteria verifiable, unambiguous, and complete?
4. Data/contracts: Are schemas, stage identities, keys, and invariants defined correctly?
5. Failure behavior: Are error handling, edge cases, and exit semantics explicit?
6. Compatibility/migration: Are deletion and replacement plans gated and reversible?
7. Testing strategy: Are test gates realistic, sufficient, and aligned to risk?
8. Operational readiness: Are observability, metrics, and rollout safeguards specified?
9. Sequencing: Is implementation order coherent and dependency-safe?

## Output Format

Produce findings first, sorted by severity descending. Include:
1. `Severity`
2. `Issue`
3. `Evidence` with file path and line reference
4. `Recommendation`
5. `How to update PRD/plan` with section-level patch guidance

Then include:
1. `Open questions/assumptions` (only if unresolved decisions remain)
2. `Optional short summary` (after findings)

If no findings exist, state that explicitly and list residual risks or testing gaps.

## PRD Update Guidance Pattern

For each finding, propose document edits that are directly actionable:
1. section to modify (for example: "US-003 Acceptance Criteria")
2. exact change type (`add`, `replace`, `clarify`, `defer`, `gate`)
3. specific text direction (what requirement to add/change and why)

## Implementation Plan Add-On

When reviewing implementation plans, additionally verify:
1. each increment is atomic and independently testable
2. each increment has a deterministic test gate
3. dependency ordering is explicit
4. rollback/remediation paths exist for risky increments
5. file ownership and touch-points are scoped to reduce regression risk

Do not implement code in this skill; review and planning quality is the deliverable.
