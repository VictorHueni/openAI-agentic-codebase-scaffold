# MADR ADR Decision

Use this skill to produce ADRs that are explicit, auditable, and easy to revisit.

## Workflow

1. Classify the request.
- `Create`: write a new ADR from scratch.
- `Update`: revise an existing ADR and keep decision history clear.
- `Review`: audit an ADR and return findings plus a proposed rewrite.

2. Gather missing inputs before drafting.
- Ask only for critical gaps: problem context, decision drivers, options, chosen option, consequences, status/date, and stakeholders.
- Keep questions short and decision-oriented.

3. Apply repository conventions first, then MADR structure.
- Default location: `docs/design-docs/architecture-decisions/`.
- If ADR numbering exists, continue the numbering pattern.
- If the repo already has ADR style/location conventions, preserve those while ensuring MADR-quality decision content.

4. Draft the ADR using the MADR templates in `references/madr-templates.md`.
- Use the full template for high-impact decisions.
- Use the minimal template for small, localized decisions.

5. Validate quality with `references/adr-quality-checklist.md`.
- Ensure one ADR contains one decision.
- Ensure options, trade-offs, and consequences are explicit.
- Ensure the chosen option is justified by decision drivers.

6. Finalize for traceability.
- Link superseded/superseding ADRs where applicable.
- Ensure title and filename are stable and searchable.
- Keep language specific; remove vague claims like "best" without criteria.

## Output Rules

- Produce Markdown only.
- Keep the narrative factual and concise.
- Prefer complete ADR drafts over outlines unless the user asks for an outline.
- If inputs are incomplete and user wants speed, draft with explicit `[ASSUMPTION]` markers and list required confirmations at the end.

## Review Mode

When asked to review an ADR:

1. Report findings first, ordered by severity (`critical`, `major`, `normal`, `low`).
2. Reference exact file paths and lines when available.
3. Focus on decision quality problems:
- missing decision drivers,
- missing alternatives,
- unjustified outcome,
- unclear consequences,
- broken traceability to prior ADRs.
4. Provide a corrected ADR text after findings if requested.

- Use `references/madr-templates.md` for canonical section structure.
- Use `references/adr-quality-checklist.md` for acceptance criteria before finalizing.
