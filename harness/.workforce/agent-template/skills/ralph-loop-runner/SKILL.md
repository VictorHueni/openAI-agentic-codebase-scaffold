# Ralph Loop Runner

## Overview

The Ralph Loop is an autonomous execution protocol that drives an implementation plan from start to finish. Each iteration implements one increment, validates it against its test gate, commits the change, and advances to the next increment.

The loop follows the principle: **Perceive → Implement → Validate → Commit → Repeat**.

A fresh agent instance handles each iteration, ensuring clean context and preventing drift. The loop terminates when all increments reach `**Status:** done`.

## Prerequisites

Before starting the Ralph Loop:

1. **PRD exists** in `docs/product-specs/` with status fields on user stories.
2. **Execution plan exists** in `docs/exec-plans/active/` with `**Status:** pending` on every increment.
3. **Peer review recommended** — run `spec-peer-reviewer` on both documents first.
4. **Test infrastructure works** — verify the project's test commands run successfully.

## Workspace Setup Protocol

Before the first iteration, prepare the workspace:

1. **Create workspace directory**: `docs/exec-plans/active/NNNN_feature-name/`
2. **Move artifacts into workspace**:
   - Copy PRD from `docs/product-specs/NNNN_prd_feature-name.md` into the workspace
   - Move exec plan from `docs/exec-plans/active/NNNN_exec_feature-name.md` into the workspace
3. **Create progress log**: `docs/exec-plans/active/NNNN_feature-name/progress.txt`
4. **Create feature branch**: `git checkout -b ralph/NNNN-feature-name`

Workspace structure after setup:

```text
docs/exec-plans/active/NNNN_feature-name/
  NNNN_prd_feature-name.md      # Copy of PRD
  NNNN_exec_feature-name.md     # Execution plan (source of truth)
  progress.txt                  # Iteration log
```

## Iteration Protocol

Each iteration follows this exact sequence:

1. **Read workspace**: Load the exec plan and find the next `**Status:** pending` increment.
2. **Set status**: Change that increment's status from `pending` to `in-progress`. Update `**Current Increment:**` in the plan header.
3. **Implement**: Execute the increment's scope items. Follow the primary files list.
4. **Run test gate**: Execute every command listed in the increment's test gate section.
5. **Pottery wheel**: If any test gate fails, fix the issue and re-run. Maximum 3 retries per increment.
6. **Mark done**: Change the increment's status from `in-progress` to `done`.
7. **Update PRD**: Check off any acceptance criteria (`- [ ]` → `- [x]`) satisfied by this increment.
8. **Commit**: Stage and commit with the convention below.
9. **Log progress**: Append an entry to `progress.txt`.
10. **Exit or continue**: If more `pending` increments remain and running interactively, continue to step 1. If running via `ralph.sh`, exit with `RALPH_COMPLETE` signal so the script can spawn a fresh agent.

## Marking Convention

Status values for increments:

- `**Status:** pending` — not yet started
- `**Status:** in-progress` — currently being implemented
- `**Status:** done` — implemented and test gate passed

Status values for milestones (in the Milestone Chunks table):

- `pending` — no increments in this milestone are done
- `in-progress` — at least one increment is done, others remain
- `done` — all increments in this milestone are done

Overall plan status:

- `**Overall Status:** pending` — no work started
- `**Overall Status:** in-progress` — at least one increment done
- `**Overall Status:** done` — all increments done

PRD user story status:

- `**Status:** pending` — not started
- `**Status:** in-progress` — some acceptance criteria checked
- `**Status:** done` — all acceptance criteria checked

## Progress Log Format

Each entry in `progress.txt` follows this format:

```text
## Iteration N
- Increment: XX — [Title]
- Status: done | blocked
- Files changed: [list]
- Test gate: passed | failed (retry M)
- Learnings: [any notable observations]
- Commit: [hash]
- Timestamp: [ISO 8601]
```

## Commit Convention

Use conventional commits with the plan ID as scope:

```text
feat|fix|refactor(NNNN): increment XX — [title]
```

Examples:

- `feat(0001): increment 01 — create database schema`
- `fix(0001): increment 03 — fix validation edge case`
- `refactor(0001): increment 05 — extract shared utilities`

## Completion Detection

The loop is complete when:

1. No increments have `**Status:** pending` or `**Status:** in-progress` in the exec plan.
2. All milestone statuses in the table are `done`.
3. `**Overall Status:**` is set to `done`.

## Archival Protocol

When all increments are done:

1. **Move PRD**: Copy from workspace back to `docs/product-specs/` (overwrite with updated checkboxes). Set PRD status to `complete`.
2. **Move exec plan**: Move from workspace to `docs/exec-plans/completed/`.
3. **Delete progress log**: Remove `progress.txt`.
4. **Remove workspace**: Delete the empty `NNNN_feature-name/` directory.
5. **Optional**: Invoke `git-pr-creator` to open a pull request for the feature branch.

## Error Recovery

### Blocked increment

If an increment cannot be completed after 3 pottery-wheel retries:

1. Set its status to `**Status:** blocked`.
2. Log the blocker in `progress.txt` with details.
3. Stop the loop — do not skip increments (they may have dependencies).
4. Notify the user with the blocker details.

### Crash recovery

If the agent or script crashes mid-iteration:

1. Check `git status` and `git log` to determine what was committed.
2. Read `progress.txt` to find the last completed iteration.
3. Find the first `**Status:** pending` or `**Status:** in-progress` increment.
4. If an increment is `in-progress` but not committed, reset it to `pending` and restart.

### Max retries

- Per-increment pottery wheel: 3 attempts maximum.
- Per-loop max iterations: configurable via `ralph.sh --max-iterations` (default: 50).
